<p>The film is 4 hours long. I watched it at the Brady Theater. When it was over, everyone sat watching the credits. I watched the film at 8pm and got out of the theater at midnight. It was raining lightly and my phone was dead.</p>
<p>I knew the general direction I needed to travel to get home, but Paris is full of sickle shaped streets: it took me an hour longer than it should have. All the while, I was stuck thinking about redemptive beauty.</p>

<p>Specifically, I was repeating a lyric from Leonard Cohen's song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7aAE5KL20Uycf3dswsaHjp?si=rosh5vBKQOaNVAMgghYuNQ">Anthem</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a crack in everything.<br />
That's how the light gets in.<br />
That's how the light gets in.  </p>
<p><cite>-- Leonard Cohen, Anthem</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since I tried to read Bukowski's novel Factotum and was left feeling appalingly depressed by the absolute emptiness and lack of hope, the presence of beauty and hope in Drama has become exceedingly important for me.</p>
<p>For a long while, I thought art couldn't be beautiful, impactful, good, unless it had something inside it to redeem all the horror and bleakness: the crack in which the light gets in.</p>
<p>Though my perspective is likely influenced by the director's recent suicide, I had trouble finding hope and beauty in Hu Bo's film, seeing past what seemed insurmountable suffering. Many characters persist but others don't: two commit suicide.</p>
<p>Humor is also muted. The closest we get to a joke is when Huang Ling retroactively calls one of her comments one (a not altogether convincing declaration).</p>
<p>And characters don't rage against their circumstances, they persist. This is especially frustrating because the film piles on explosive sudden events, what Justin Chang perfectly describes in his LA Times review as "a soap opera season’s worth of romantic indiscretions, sudden deaths, unfortunate accidents, provoked and unprovoked attacks"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>These events lack their natural function: in the soap opera tradition they exist to incite strong emotional reactions, adding modulation to characters who otherwise would appear excedingly flat.</p>
<p>Instead, as disasters befall them, Bo'scharacters become more entrenched in who they are. Not inspired to act, but rather convinced that acting is meaningless. The persistence and transformation in <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em> reminds me of <em>Macbeth</em>, specifically the "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow" soliloquy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br />
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />
Signifying nothing.  </p>
<p><cite>-- Shakespeare, Macbeth<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macbeth certainly could have proved an inspiration for Hu Bo's film: his mentor Bela Tarr directed an adaption, which it is likely Bo saw.</p>
<p>I left the film depressed, but also deeply moved. Frustrated, but disabused from the idea that art cannot be profoundly bleak.</p>
<div class="header-link-padding" id="fault-and-culpability"></div><h2 class="group relative z-0"><a class="header-link absolute opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 pin-l pin-t transition-ease" href="#fault-and-culpability">#</a>Fault and culpability</h2>
<p>Blame is another aspect of <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em> that fascinates me.</p>
<p>In Bo's An Elephant Sitting Still, characters ceaselessly blame each other. Yu Cheng blames both his girlfriend and his ex for the death of his friend; and his parents blame him for the death of his brother.</p>
<p>Wei Bu blames his friend for revealing his location to his parents, and a bully blames that same friend for the theft of a cellphone.</p>
<p>The owner of the stray dog blames Wang Jin for the disappearance of his dog. Wang Yuwen's teacher blames her for ruining his teaching career.</p>
<p>Why do all these characters feel a need to exteriorize their anguish into blame: a pattern that endlessly perpetuates and resolves nothing. Is this the only recourse when life offers no answers, a way of dealing with guilt, ?</p>
<p>I was also curious what this meant for a culture that is "collectivist". Putting aside the fact that individualism and collectivism are too all emcompasing to mean much, the idea of blame seems antithetical to community (beyond scapegoating).</p>

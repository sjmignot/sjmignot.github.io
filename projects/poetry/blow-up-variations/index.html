<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>If one might say: I will see the moon rose, or: we hurt me at</p>
<p>the back of my eyes, and especially: you the blonde woman</p>
<p>was the clouds that race before me you’re his our yours their faces.</p>
<cite>- Julio Cortazar</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>I will see. The moon rose it was just the day fading the sun.  </p>
<p>I had just started to wear glasses convinced they would help me  </p>
<p>with my photography, hopeful they would delimit the world --  </p>
<p>cut distance between eyes and the lenses of my camera.  </p>
<p>Though, I have yet to see anything new. The world is the same. Though  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>now the trees have more limbs than you would expect them to; They’re all  </p>
<p>leaves and bark seeing how far they can get, new angles at the sun.  </p>
<p>And a woman smokes a cigarette and I see, as she drags,  </p>
<p>the cigarette breathing her in and the smoke that leaves her  </p>
<p>is a part of her body--some exhausted piece of lung--she knows  </p>
<p>she can never get back. And I have always wanted to be someone  </p>
<p>who smoked. The beauty of holding in what you will have  </p>
<p>to give back. Being Belmondo or Bogart for all the time it takes  </p>
<p>the smoke to clear, the world you can’t see marked in the way  </p>
<p>the smoke moves before it is lost in the hidden labyrinth of the sky;  </p>
<p>the paths the wind makes from stasis; no thread to drag it out of itself.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The smoke follows her hand a short-term memory of her motions: time  </p>
<p>wrestled between her index finger and middle finger and then gone.  </p>
<p>A dog walks along the quay and looks into the river  </p>
<p>like it is all the water he has ever seen and his tongue is drying  </p>
<p>in the sun. If only he could look inside, turn his eyes and see the  </p>
<p>lakes in his body--the reservoir that is his blood. His body so drenched  </p>
<p>on the inside. There is so much water inside him. If he knew,  </p>
<p>he would never need to drink again. Kneel next to him and tell him:  </p>
<p>I will not forgive the way we hurt me. He will know what you mean.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>At the back of my eyes I am reconciling my eyes.  </p>
<p>In storefronts, mannequins are badly navigating the uncanny valley.  </p>
<p>You must spend the light carefully: Remember how Antonioni took too many photos  </p>
<p>and ended up with a movie.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Forget about still-lifes because the sun is moving and doesn’t want to be caught.  </p>
<p>Instead, remember still-alive: how Tolstoy would epigraph all his jounal entries  </p>
<p>Which might as well be true because it is beautiful  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The day ends as you stand in the darkroom. You see my arm disappear  </p>
<p>as you stretch it out. The room is black and smells so strong  </p>
<p>the air feels solid. The dark buzzing static is a certain softness  </p>
<p>you decide is simply not knowing how far away the walls are  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>and how far the world is and especially how far you are. And you know  </p>
<p>the woman, the one who was smoking. The blonde woman, was the clouds  </p>
<p>that race before me: and you are his, our, yours, their faces.  </p>

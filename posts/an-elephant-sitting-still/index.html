<p>The film is 4 hours long. I watched it at the Brady Theater. When it was over, everyone sat watching the credits. I watched the film at 8pm and got out of the theater at midnight. It was raining lightly and my phone was dead.</p>
<p>I knew the general direction I needed to travel to get home, but Paris is full of sickle shaped streets: it took me an hour longer than it should have. All the while, I was stuck thinking about redemptive beauty.</p>

<p>Specifically, I was repeating a lyric from Leonard Cohen's song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7aAE5KL20Uycf3dswsaHjp?si=rosh5vBKQOaNVAMgghYuNQ">Anthem</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a crack in everything.<br />
That's how the light gets in.<br />
That's how the light gets in.  </p>
<p><cite>-- Leonard Cohen, Anthem</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since I tried to read Bukowski's novel Factotum and was left feeling appalingly depressed by the absolute emptiness and lack of hope, the presence of beauty and hope in Drama has become exceedingly important to me.</p>
<p>For a long while, I thought art couldn't be beautiful, impactful, good, unless it had something inside it to redeem all the horror and bleakness: the crack in which the light gets in.</p>
<p>Though my perspective is likely influenced by the director's recent suicide, I had trouble finding hope and beauty in Hu Bo's film, seeing past what seemed insurmountable suffering. Many characters persist but others don't: two commit suicide.</p>
<p>Humor is also muted. The closest we get to a joke is when Huang Ling retroactively calls one of her comments one (a not altogether convincing declaration).</p>
<p>And characters don't rage against their circumstances, they simply persist. This is especially frustrating because the film piles on explosive, sudden events, what Justin Chang perfectly describes in his LA Times review as "a soap opera season’s worth of romantic indiscretions, sudden deaths, unfortunate accidents, provoked and unprovoked attacks"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="an elephant sitting still" src="/static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-2.jpg" srcset="/static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-2-sm.jpg 480w, /static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-2-md.jpg 640w, /static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-2-lg.jpg 1024w" />

<p>These events lack their natural function: in the soap opera tradition they exist to incite strong emotional reactions, adding modulation to characters who otherwise would appear excedingly flat.</p>
<p>Instead, as disasters befall them, Bo's characters become more entrenched in who they are. Not inspired to act, but rather convinced that acting is meaningless<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The persistence and transformation in <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em> reminds me of <em>Macbeth</em>, specifically the "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow" soliloquy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br />
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />
Signifying nothing.  </p>
<p><cite>-- Shakespeare, Macbeth[^3]</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macbeth certainly could have proved an inspiration for Hu Bo's film: his mentor Bela Tarr directed an adaption, which it is altogether probable that Bo saw.</p>
<p>I stress the importance of hope in art, but have never been bothered by it's relative absence in Shakespeare's tragedies. Or, if I've considered it, I've always concluded that the beauty of the language redeems the violence of the content. After all, isn't beauty a kind of hope?</p>
<p>The same mechanisms must be at play in <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em>. I left the film depressed, but also deeply moved. Frustrated, but disabused from the idea that art cannot be profoundly bleak.</p>
<div class="post-header__padding" id="fault-and-culpability"></div><h2 class="post__header"><a class="header-link" href="#fault-and-culpability">#</a>Fault and culpability</h2>
<p>Blame is another aspect of <em>An Elephant Sitting Still</em> that fascinates me.</p>
<p>Characters ceaselessly blame each other. Yu Cheng blames both his girlfriend and his ex for the death of his friend; and his parents blame him for the death of his brother.</p>
<p><img alt="an elephant sitting still" src="/static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-3.jpg" srcset="/static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-3-sm.jpg 480w, /static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-3-md.jpg 640w, /static/img/post-images/an-elephant-sitting-still/an-elephant-sitting-still-3-lg.jpg 1024w" />
<em>frame from an elephant sitting still: Yu Cheng blaming his ex</em></p>
<p>Wei Bu blames his friend for revealing his location to his parents, and a bully blames that same friend for the theft of a cellphone.</p>
<p>The owner of the stray dog blames Wang Jin for the disappearance of his dog. Wang Yuwen's teacher blames her for ruining his teaching career.</p>
<p>This tendency to "blame" is another tie between Bo's film and the soap opera tradition. Soap opera's exploit betrayal, blame, and fault to create clear and consumable relationships between characters.</p>
<p>However, once more Bo refuses to give us something concrete. For his characters, blame seems a grasping at straws. One character in particular, Yu Cheng, is uniquely unconvincing: it doesn't seem like he even believes those he blames are responsible.</p>
<p>With respect to blame, Bo leaves us with one central question: why is personal anguish exteriorized into blame, a pattern that endlessly perpetuates and resolves nothing. </p>
<p>Is it the only recourse when life offers no answers, a way of dealing with personal guilt?</p>
<div class="post-header__padding" id="sound-and-music"></div><h2 class="post__header"><a class="header-link" href="#sound-and-music">#</a>Sound and music</h2>
<p>Although Bo's film is long, it is masterfully paced. Bo develops the same form of <a href="/post/andrei-rublev">slow suspense that Tarkovsky uses in Andrei Rublev</a>.</p>
<p>Though the product of a myrriad of elements, the excellent pacing of the film is closely tied to music, and, even more so, silence.</p>
<p>More and more often, I am aware and dissapointed by the reliance of films on music for emotional impact. Most recently, I noticed this in Phillips' Joker and Gray's Ad Astra and the television series Mr. Robot.</p>
<p>In each of these, dramatic background music is injected in the background of speeches.</p>
<p>Yet, if the writing is good enough, if the acting is good enough, then it doesn't need to be.</p>
<p>Putting dramatic music in the background of a movie speech is like putting floaties on a swimmer: if they don't know how to swim it'll probably keep them from drowning, if they're trying to get somewhere it'll slow them down, if they're professionals it'll be a goddamn catastrophy.</p>
<p>The modern overmusicing of movies always brings back to Chaplin's <em>The Great Dictator</em>: the final speech.</p>
<p>The film was made in 1940, but the writing is impeccable, the acting killer. Without music, the speech is real, raw, honest.</p>
<p>Yet, the most viewed version of the speech on Youtube is overlayed with Hans Zimmer's Time...</p>
<p>This dependence hurts music and film, but is also indicative of a greater reliance on sound: silence is becomming less and less of an option. Silence is</p>

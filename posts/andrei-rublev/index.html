<p>It is hard to unpack a Tarkovsky film. You take any thread, start pulling and it turns out to be the entire tapestry. Which is not to say that his movies are simple. Rather that everything is linked. The length of the thread is time and time ducks into itself.</p>

<p>After watching a film you leave with moments folded into each other: a composite. What you watched existed in time, but your reflections are necessarily condensed: a kind of emotional singularity.</p>
<p>This is what makes review or summary of temporal art (film, literature, music) a strange but fascinating process. Experience of the piece involves a mapping, compression, into atemporal memory<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Recall involves temporal restoration, which is inevitably a lossy process.</p>
<p>Though all of this may sound a hasty premeditated complaint of the writing that follows, though it very well might be, it does seem the kind of preamble Tarkovsky would have appreciated. After all, he modestly called his art "sculpting in time".</p>

<p>Tarkovsky is not known for suspense: he is known for long takes, and slow cinema. But, in the final chapter of Andrei Rublev, he contructs a beautiful, grounding, human, and suspensful scene.</p>
<p>It isn't the kind of scene that causes hearts to leap or armchairs to be knuckled. It is slow suspense, that catches you and patiently wraps you in the give and pull of the scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mystery is when the spectator knows less than the characters in the movie. Suspense is when the spectator knows more than the characters in the movie.</p>
<p><cite> -- Alfred Hitchock </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitchcock famously connected suspense and dramatic irony: the audience "knowing more" than the film's characters. However, with Tarkovsky, we don't <strong>know more</strong> than characters, we only think we do. This is an important and powerful distinction that is essential to the unique brand of suspense that Tarkovsky create.</p>
<p><img alt="andrei-rublev" src="/static/img/post-images/andrei-rublev/andrei-rublev-2.jpg" srcset="/static/img/post-images/andrei-rublev/andrei-rublev-2-sm.jpg 320w, /static/img/post-images/andrei-rublev/andrei-rublev-2-md.jpg 640w, /static/img/post-images/andrei-rublev/andrei-rublev-2-lg.jpg 1024w" />
<em>frame from andrei rublev: the ringing of the bell</em></p>
<p>Th final chapter of Tarkovsky's epic Andrei Rublev shows the medieval process for creating a church bell. A young boy, Boriska, is commisioned to make the bell. Tarkovsky foreshadows conflict and hints with Hollywood style suspense tropes:</p>
<p>The young bell maker is told that the argile coat that serves as the mold for the making of a bell won't hold. He reacts harshly, sending his skeptical friend to be whipped. In the tradition of suspense cinema, this should be a strong clue that the mold is inadequate: that it will break. </p>
<p>But it holds.</p>
<p>But the suspense does not end there with anti-climactic resolution: it persists. Part of this is likely do to Burlyaev's acting (which I thought was stunning, but that Tarkovsky pans in his book <em>Sculpting in Time</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kolya Burlyaev as Boriska, the bell-caster's son in Audrey Rublyov was working with me for the second time after Ivan's Childhood. All the time we were shooting I had to give him to understand through my assistants that I was thoroughly dissatisfied with his work, and might retake his scenes using another actor. I wanted him to feel disaster hanging over him, perhaps about to fall, so that he would genuinely be feeling acutely insecure. Burlyaev is an extraordinarily dissipated, shallow and ostentatious actor. His bursts of temperament are artificial. That was why I had to have recourse to such severe measures.</p>
<p><cite> -- Andrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the insecurity of Boriska, that generates suspense, which is insanely innovative because it works inside-out rather than the outside-in of Hitchcockian suspense. </p>
<p>The suspense, and Boriska's insecurity, are both heighetned when the bell is raised. Boriska is told that they should have gotten chains: that the rope may not hold.</p>
<p>We see the bell raised: it is an arduous process and the constant shots of strained ropes generate doubt and echo Boriska's insecurity. In the fillm tradition, we are taught to equate what is shown with what is important. A mapping of shots to pure plot functionality. But the bell is raised without problem. Still, the feeling of suspense that Tarkovsky has built doesn't diffuse.</p>
<p>The ringing of the bell, hypnotic, slow, should prove complete carthasis. A final resolultion for the creation of the bell that answers or lingering concerns: will it sound good? is there something wrong with it? Will it crack? But the bell rings and it rings well.</p>
<p>Yet, even though there is nothing left for us to doubt, the feeling of suspense remains.</p>
<p>Not until Boriska breaks down in Rublev's arms, not until the internal (inside-out) emotional release, is the immense pressure that Tarkovsky builds diffused.</p>
<p>Though I must stress that this process is perhaps coincidental. In his writings Tarkovsky is adament in creating films that don't push against but rather excise cinematic tropes. Therefore, my reading through the lens of susepense conventions could be a symptom of my western cinematic upbringing.</p>
<p>But I think it remains essential to recognize that every film exists in "the cinematic tradition". The power of Tarkovsky's cinema is, in part, dependent on that of Kurosawa and Hitchcock, Hollywood and the New Wave. It also goes without saying that Tarkovsky watched films from these directors and movements: that they, inevitably, became a part of his cinematic language.</p>

<p>After witnessing the horrors of a barbarian invasion, Rublev takes a vow of silence. At the end of the film, the vow is broken which as accompanied with a different but equally significant unmuting. The film, up to that point entirely in black and white, switches to color.</p>

<em>clip from andrei rublev: panning over fragments of rublev paintings</em>
</p>

<p>This parallel seems fundamental in challenging and creating a film is art in itself that is not a mesh, pel-mel of other forms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinema is said to be a composite art, based on the involvement of a number of neighbour art forms: drama, prose, acting, painting, music.... In fact the 'involvement' of these art forms can, as it turns out, impinge so heavily on cinema as to reduce it to a kind of mishmash, or—at best—to a mere semblance of harmony in which the heart of cinema is not to be found, because it is precisely in those conditions that it ceases to exist. It has to be made clear once and for all that if cinema is an art it cannot simply be an amalgam of the principles of other, contiguous art forms: only having done that can we turn to the question of the allegedly composite nature of film. A meld of literary thought and painterly form will not be a cinematic image: it can only produce a more or less empty or pretentious hybrid.</p>
<p><cite> -- Andrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Tarkovsky explicitly mentions the danger of styllistically emulating painting for "period dramas" such as Andrei Rublev. This is made most explicit and powerful in the final scene of Andrei Rublev, which pans and zooms over Andrei Rublev's paintings. In a way rewriting or shifting the representational dialog: film beggetting painting instead of vice versa. Rublev's art is inscribed in the laws and world of film.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am reminded of how we worked on Andrey Rublyov. The film is set in the fifteenth century, and it turned out to be excruciatingly difficult to picture 'how everything was'. We had to use any sources we could: architecture, the written word, iconography.<br />
Had we gone for reconstruction of the picturesque tradition of the picturesque world of those times, the result would have been a stylised, conventional ancient Russian world, of the kind that at best is reminiscent of miniatures or icons of the period. But for cinema that is not the right way. I have never understood, for instance, attempts to construct mise en scene from a painting. All you will be doing is bringing the painting back to life, and duly being rewarded with superficial acclaim: 'Ah, what a feeling for the period!' 'Ah, what cultivated people!' But you will also be killing cinema.<br />
Therefore one of the aims of our work was to reconstruct for a modern audience the real world of the fifteenth century, that is, to present that world in such a way that costume, speech, life-style and architecture would not give the audience any feeling of relic, of antiquarian rarity. In order to achieve the truth of direct observation, what one might almost term physiological truth, we had to move away from the truth of archaeology and ethnography. Inevitably there was an element of artificiality, but this was the antithesis of that of the revived painting.</p>
<p><cite> -- Andrei Tarkovsky, Sculpting in Time<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tarkovsky seems obsessed with generating styllistic independence in the young art form of cinema. The final scene of the film, the movement of color and sound between, seem testaments to this simultaneous fear and desire: ways of generating independence from color (painting) and sound (music) respectively.</p>
